# DM1-Autism-RNABinding

Scripts generated to analyze the involvement of RNA Binding Proteins in DM1-associated autism for the manuscript titled 'Autistic traits in myotonic dystrophy type 1 due to MBNL sequestration and RNA mis-splicing of autism-risk genes' (2024).

This work was carried out as part of my PhD thesis under the supervision of Dr. Ryan Yuen (The University of Toronto; The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto) and with guidance from Dr. ≈Åukasz Sznajder (University of Nevada, Las Vegas).
